# Numbers
Small project to learn some ASP.Net Core and C#

# The Project
A web page where we can see a table with the numbers stored in the data base.
We can store numbers to the data base 
It has an API where you can submit the id’s of the numbers you want and it calculate the sum of the respective numbers.

# Intructions
Run the program on your IDE and it will show the Welcome page.

“Click Here to Start” (on the top of the screen) and let’s go.

This page will show you a table with the id’s and the respective numbers, a button to delete the respective number and two more buttons on the right corner.

“Save a number” will take you to a different page where you can save a number to the database. Click on “save” to save the number or “back to list” to get back to the previous page.

“Calculate” will take you to our API. In here you can pass the id-s of the numbers you want to sum. You can use symbols to separate the numbers you want to enter (EX: 1-3-4; or 1, 4, 5).  Click on “show result” and you will get your sum result.
